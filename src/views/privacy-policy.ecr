<h2>Use of personal data</h2>

<p>
  We use Google for authentication, the only information we store is
  the mail address of the Google account you used to login.
</p>

<p>
  When you sign up, we send you through authorization flows
  at <a href="https://nordigen.com">Nordigen</a>
  and <a href="https://www.ynab.com/">YNAB</a>, which returns tokens
  to us. These tokens allow the us to fetch your account transactions
  from the bank you selected, and import them to YNAB. We only have
  read access to your account data at your bank, and we only use the
  YNAB connection to push transactions from your bank.
</p>

<p>
  We do not track your usage, but if you encounter a crash of the app,
  some very basic information like your IP address and user agent
  string will be associated with the crash report collected
  by <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a>. This is purely for
  debugging and will be automatically deleted after 14 days. 
</p>

<p>
  As this service relies on other services, you implicitly agree to
  their terms of service, and their privacy policy applies to your
  dealings with them.

## 1.6.3 - Unreleased

## 1.6.2 - 2025-03-29
### Chonged
- Use the logging system when capturing messages for manual runs
  rather than have the worker duplicate the messages.

### Fixed
- Handling EUA expired and rate limit errors so they don't show up in
  Honeybadger.

## 1.6.1 - 2025-01-24
### Fixed
- Don't retry every five minutes when hitting rate limit, but postpone
  to next scheduled run.
- Use BigDecimal for amount calculation. Floating point errors is
  possible even in the simple "multiply decimal amount from bank with
  1000" calculation we do.

## 1.6.0 - 2024-08-20
### Changed
- Limit sync interval to minimum 6 hours. Nordigen will be rate
  limiting to 4 request per account every 24 hours soon.

### Added

## 1.5.2 - 2024-08-09
### Changed
- Also log message body on YNAB token refresh errors.
- Send exceptions to Honeybadger instead of Sentry.

## 1.5.1 - 2024-03-23
### Changed
- Try to identify EUA expired errors, so we can handle them
  specifically at some point.
  
### Fixed
- Skip unknown accounts, but carry on syncing.
- Catch 409 when fetching accounts. Seems that deleted accounts can
  still show up on the requisition, but return error when fetched.
- Catch EUA expired errors and disable automatic sync.
